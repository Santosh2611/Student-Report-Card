# Student-Report-Card
A mini-C++ project has a student class with data members such as roll number, name, marks and grade. Member functions are used to accept/display details of students and calculate grades based on marks obtained. The menu-driven program can read, write, search, modify and delete operations in a binary file.

---

This project is a C++ program for managing student data and generating their report cards. The program allows users to create, display, search, modify, and delete student records.

## Features
- Create Student Record: Users can input details such as roll number, name, and marks in various subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, English) for each student.
- Display All Students' Records: View all the student records stored in the system.
- Search Student Record: Look up a specific student's record by their roll number.
- Modify Student Record: Update the details of a student by entering their roll number and providing new information.
- Delete Student Record: Remove a student's record from the system using their roll number.
- Class Result: Display the result of all the students in a tabular format showing their roll number, name, marks in different subjects, percentage, and grade.
- Student Report Card: View the individual report card of a student by entering their roll number.
